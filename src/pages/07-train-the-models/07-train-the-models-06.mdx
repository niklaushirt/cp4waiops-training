## üöÄ TASK: Define and run Temporal Grouping training
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.7.0?topic=algorithms-temporal-grouping" target="_blank" >üåè Documentation for the Task: Setting up training for temporal grouping</a>



This AI algorithm can start to discover groups after a pattern is learned, which might take hours or days. For example, if a problem occurs in the first and the fourth week of January and again in March, the algorithm learns to group the alerts that tend to co-occur when the problem happens.

In this section you will set up and run training for this AI algorithm to `learn patterns` in Event occurence and group patterns witt `temporal correlation`.
