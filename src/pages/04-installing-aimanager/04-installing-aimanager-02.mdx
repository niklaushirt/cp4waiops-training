## üöÄ TASK: Verify that the CP4WAIOPS Installation is ready


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.7.0?topic=manager-starter-installation-cli" target="_blank" >üåè Documentation for the Task: Online starter installation of CP4WAIOPS</a>



Check that CP4WAIOPS is running and that you can continue with the next chapter to install the third-party systems that will support your training.

You can do this by checking the running Pods in the `cp4waiops` Namespace.

There should be more than 120 Pods with Status `Running` and all should be `Ready` (meaning they have show 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, ...)

## Check with the Command Line

Run the following:
	
```bash
while :; do clear; echo "Checking..."; echo "Exit with Ctrl-C"; echo "---------------"; echo "Ready: $(oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep -v '0/' |wc -l| tr -d ' ')"; echo "Not Ready:     $(oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep '0/' |wc -l| tr -d ' ')"; echo "---------------"; oc get po -n cp4waiops | grep -v Completed | grep -v Error |grep '0/'; sleep 5; done
```

<br/>

This will list the Pods that are not Ready yet.

<br/>

‚úÖ And **when done** you should get 0 Pods `Not Ready`, about `Ready: 12x` and `Not Ready: 0`.




## Check with your OpenShift Web Console

1. Select `Pods` and your `cp4waiops` Project

1. Filter for the relevant statuses

	The drop-down also shows you the number of Pods for the different statuses.

1. Sort by `Ready` column

This allows you to follow along the progress of the installation.

‚úÖ **When done** you should have more than 120 Pods in Running status and all Pods should be `1/1, 2/2, 3/3, ...`
