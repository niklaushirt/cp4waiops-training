1. Run the following command:
 
	```yaml
	cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
	apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
	kind: Subscription
	metadata:
	  name: ibm-aiops-orchestrator
	  namespace: cp4waiops
	spec:
	  channel: v3.7
	  installPlanApproval: Automatic
	  name: ibm-aiops-orchestrator
	  source: ibm-operator-catalog
	  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
	EOF

This creates the Operator Instance via the `Subscription` that will be looking for an `Installation` definition and start the installation if it exists (you will create this in one of the next steps).
