The purpose of this guide is to provide a self-contained set of instructions to integrate with ServiceNow, summarizing instructions from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cloud-pak-watson-aiops/3.5.1?topic=connections-servicenow-connection" target="_blank" >IBM Documentation</a>  and other sources.




ServiceNow integrations provide historical and live data for change requests, incidents, and problems. ServiceNow integrations also provide inventory data for the ServiceNow observer.
