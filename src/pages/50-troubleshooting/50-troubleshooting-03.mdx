## Monitor ElasticSearch Indexes with Browser

Run `./tools/28_access_elastic.sh` in a separate terminal window.

This allows you to access ElasticSearch and gives you:

* ES User
* ES Password

### Monitor ElasticSearch Indexes from Firefox

I use the [Elasticvue](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elasticvue/) Firefox plugin.

Follow these steps to connects from Elasticvue:

- Select `Add Cluster` 

	![](./../images/es1.png)



- Put in the credentials and make sure you put `https` and not `http` in the URL

	![](./../images/es2.png)

- Click `Test Connection` - you will get an error
- Click on the `https://localhost:9200` URL

	![](./../images/es3.png)
	


- This will open a new Tab, select `Accept Risk and Continue` 

	![](./../images/es4.png)

- Cancel the login screen and go back to the previous tab
- Click `Connect` 
- You should now be connected to your CP4WAIOPS ElasticSearch instance
