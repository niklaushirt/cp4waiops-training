**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

Now that we know what the problem is, let’s correct what has happened. A runbook has been automatically identified but have not been executed. Runbooks are guided steps that IT operations teams use to troubleshoot and resolve problems. Some organizations might call these standard operating procedures or playbooks. When an incident occurs, IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps matches an appropriate runbook to the problem. The runbook can be set to run automatically when it is matched to an incident, or it can run with user approval and participation. 

Let’s execute the Runbook.

>**🚀 <u>Action</u>**
>
>Click on the three dots and click **Run**
>
>Click **Start Runbook**.

**❗ <u>Note</u>**: The execution of the runbook can take few minutes.

**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

The Runbook that I just started kicks off a Playbook on Ansible Tower. I can follow the execution as it connects to the cluster and then scales up memory for the MySQL deployment.

>When finished, click **Complete**.

>Open the RobotShop application. Verify that ratings are correctly shown

**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

Before confirming that the runbook worked as expected, I should check the RobotShop application to see if it is working as expected.

>**🚀 <u>Action</u>**

>Rate the Runbook
>
>Then click **Runbook Worked**.

**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

So the runbook has resolved the problem. When I tell Watson AIOps that the Runbook worked, it will learn over time to prioritize and suggest more relevant Runbooks.

So now as we have resolved the problem,  I will inform the development team of the problem by reopening the ServiceNow ticket and by closing the Story.
