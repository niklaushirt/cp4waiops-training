**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

The interface shows the **topology** of the application that is relevant to the incident. IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps’ topology service delivers a working understanding of the resources that you have in your environment, how the resources relate to each other, and how the environment has changed over time.

You can see that there are some statuses attached to the different resources, marked with colorful dots. Let’s view the details and status of the **mysql** resource with red status.

**📣 <u>Narration</u>** 

The topology service provides operations teams with complete up-to-date visibility over dynamic infrastructure, resources, and services. The topology service lets you query a specific resource for details, and other relevant information. Here I can see all Alerts for the mysql database resource for example.
